The system clock gets set to either UTC or Local based on the last option used when the hwclock function was run. If you run:

#hwclock -w --localtime

This should write your system clock to local time instead of UTC and should subsequently set it and read it at boot 
using local time. 

If you manually set your system clock and the hwclock was last specified with UTC then it will automatically set it back to 
UTC.
